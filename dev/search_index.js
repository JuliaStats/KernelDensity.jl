The optional keyword arguments are\n\nboundary: the lower and upper limits of the kde as a tuple. Due to the fourier transforms used internally, there should be sufficient spacing to prevent wrap-around at the boundaries.\nnpoints: the number of interpolation points to use. The function uses fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) internally, so for optimal efficiency this should be a power of 2 (default = 2048).\nkernel: the distributional family from Distributions.jl to use as the kernel (default = Normal). To add your own kernel, extend the internal kernel_dist function.\nbandwidth: the bandwidth of the kernel. Default is to use Silverman's rule.\nweights: A vector of weights for each observation. Can be one of UniformWeights (the default, from this package), an AbstractVector of real numbers, or a StatsBase.Weights vector.\n\nThe UnivariateKDE object U contains gridded coordinates (U.x) and the density estimate (U.density). These are typically sufficient for plotting. A related function\n\nkde_lscv(data)\n\nwill construct a UnivariateKDE object, with the bandwidth selected by least-squares cross validation. It accepts the above keyword arguments, except bandwidth.\n\nThere are also some slightly more advanced interfaces:\n\nkde(data, midpoints::R) where R<:AbstractRange\n\nallows specifying the internal grid to use. Optional keyword arguments are kernel and bandwidth.\n\nkde(data, dist::Distribution)\n\nallows specifying the exact distribution to use as the kernel. Optional keyword arguments are boundary and npoints.\n\nkde(data, midpoints::R, dist::Distribution) where R<:AbstractRange\n\nallows specifying both the distribution and grid.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Bivariate","page":"KernelDensity.jl","title":"Bivariate","text":"The usage mirrors that of the univariate case, except that data is now either a tuple of vectors\n\nB = kde((xdata, ydata))\n\nor a matrix with two columns\n\nB = kde(datamatrix)\n\nSimilarly, the optional arguments all now take tuple arguments: e.g. boundary now takes a tuple of tuples ((xlo,xhi),(ylo,yhi)).\n\nThe BivariateKDE object B contains gridded coordinates (B.x and B.y) and the bivariate density estimate (B.density).","category":"section"},{"location":"#Interpolation","page":"KernelDensity.jl","title":"Interpolation","text":"The KDE objects are stored as gridded density values, with attached coordinates.
